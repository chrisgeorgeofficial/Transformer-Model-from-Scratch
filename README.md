# TransformerModel Notebook

This repository contains an experimental Jupyter Notebook implementation of core concepts behind **Transformers** (inspired by GPT-like models).  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This notebook is currently **not completed**. Development is in progress.

---

## üìÇ File Overview
**`TransformerModel.ipynb`** includes step-by-step code and explanations related to transformers:

1. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Example: Installing `torchtyping` for type checking in PyTorch.

2. **GPT Dataset Problem**
   - Discussion and code around dataset preparation for GPT-like models.
   - Example: Using `torch` and `typing` for dataset batching.

3. **Self-Attention Problem**
   - Initial implementation of **Self-Attention** using PyTorch.
   - Work in progress, includes different approaches.

4. **Alternative Method**
   - Second attempt/variation of implementing self-attention.

---

## üìä Current Status
- ‚úÖ Basic dataset loading and preparation started.  
- ‚úÖ Initial self-attention implementation drafted.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Work is incomplete: functions need refinement, testing, and integration.
